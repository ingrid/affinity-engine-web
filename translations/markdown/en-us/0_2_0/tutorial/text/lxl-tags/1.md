Notice how text fades in one letter at a time? That's possible because of `ember-letter-by-letter`, a library we created specifically to support the Affinity Engine. Because we wanted the dialogue to be as expressive as possible, we added `lxl-tags`, which can change the way text behaves in the middle of a sentence. To learn all about `lxl-tags` and see some demos, check out the [`ember-letter-by-letter` docs](http://null-null-null.github.io/ember-letter-by-letter/#/lxl-tags).

For the time being, let's play around with a couple of the tags, specifically `pause` and `rate`.

For instance, let's say we want Ember to pause briefly after saying 'Wait?':

```js
yield ember._.text("Wait? [[pause 1000]] Did you say we're starting the best tutorial?");
```

Here, the double `[[` and `]]` surround the tag, while `pause` says what kind of tag it is and `1000` is the first argument that we're passing in. In this case, that argument is telling the tag how many milliseconds to pause before the next 'mic test' gets written.
