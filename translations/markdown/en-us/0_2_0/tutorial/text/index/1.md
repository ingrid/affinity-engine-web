In the previous section, we learned how to configure and execute directions. As a side effect, we also learned quite a bit about the `text` direction, such as how to give it a caption or change its class name. In this section, we'll dive a little deeper into the `text` direction, learning how to add static text, translate it into multiple languages, and even respond to Twine-style callbacks.

You can also find the full documentation for the `text` direction [here](/#/api/stage/directions/text).

```js
import { Scene } from 'affinity-engine-stage';
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Scene.extend({
  start: task(function * (script) {
    const diy = script.character('diy');
    const ember = script.character('ember');

    yield diy._.text("Oh, how exciting! We're starting the text tutorial.");
    yield ember._.text("Wait? Did you say we're starting the next tutorial?");
    yield diy._.text("Well, kind of! We're starting the text tutorial, but it's also the next one.");
  })
});

```
