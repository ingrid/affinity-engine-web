When your designer sees this, they're not too happy. They want all menus to have the default `'ae-paper'` styles. As before, we can achieve this effect by manually specifying the `classNames` on every menu, but that's tedious and brittle. Instead, we can rely on _configuration tiers_ to configure all text directions, but not other types of directions. If you go to the [`text` API docs](#/api/stage/directions/text), you'll find the Configuration Tiers section near the top of the page. It looks something like this:

* component.stage.direction.text
* text
* component.stage.direction.prompt
* prompt
* component.stage.direction.all
* component.stage.all
* all

Compare that to the [`menu` API docs](#/api/stage/directions/menu):

* component.stage.direction.menu
* menu
* component.stage.direction.prompt
* prompt
* component.stage.direction.all
* component.stage.all
* all

You'll notice that the last five tiers are identical, while the top two are different. It's those top levels we should target if we want different behavior between text and menu directions. To do that, we nest configuration objects:

```js
// app/affinity-engine/config.js
export default {
  component: {
    stage: {
      direction: {
        text: {
          attrs: {
            classNames: 'ae-coastal ae-block'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Higher configuration tiers receive precedence over lower ones. So for instance, `component.stage.direction.text` will overwrite configurations in `text`, `component.stage.direction.prompt`, `all`, and all the rest.

The end result is what our designer asked for:
