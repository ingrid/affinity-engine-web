The `affinity-engine-curtain` is a preloader. It will cycle through all your fixtures and preload the assets you specify on them, such as images and music. It works especially well with [`ember-progress-bar`](https://github.com/null-null-null/ember-progress-bar) to display the current progress of the preloading.

#### Installation

```bash
ember install affinity-engine-curtain
```

#### Usage

```hbs
{{#affinity-engine engineId='queers-in-space' fixtures=fixtures as |engine|}}
  {{#if engine.isLoaded}}
    {{affinity-engine-stage engineId=engine.engineId}}
  {{else}}
    {{#affinity-engine-curtain
      engineId=engine.engineId
      filesToPreload=(hash keyframes="src")
      as |curtain|
    }}
      <div>{{curtain.title}}</div>
      {{ember-progress-bar
        progress=curtain.progress
        useDefaultStep=true
      }}
    {{/affinity-engine-curtain}}
  {{/if}}
{{/affinity-engine}}
```

#### Arguments

##### `engineId`

The unique string identifier shared between an engine and all its components. Be sure to use the same `engineId` as the one you provided to the `affinity-engine` itself.

##### `filesToPreload`

A hash describing the attributes to load for each fixture. For instance, each `keyframes` fixture has an `src` image that would be preloaded with `(hash keyframes="src")`. If multiple attributes should be prelaoded for each fixture, they should be space separated, such as `(hash keyframes="src otherAttribute")`.

#### Properties

##### `progress`

What percentage of the assets have been preloaded, as a number between 0 and 100.

##### `title`

The title of the engine, as defined in the `config`. If an `intl` plugin is installed, it'll first be translated if a translation is available.
